# Building
Note: currently Grappa does not support any 'install' step. To use, build using the instructions below. New applications can be added to the applications folder, using the existing applications' `CMakeLists.txt` files as an example, and built using Grappa's CMake project.

This document describes how to use CMake to perform out-of-source builds. This means that for each configuration, a new "build/*" directory will be created to hold all of the build scripts, temporaries, and built libraries and executables.

## Quick start
Example usage:

    ./configure --gen=Make --mode=Release
    cd build/Make+Release
    make -j

This will build the Grappa static library (in `build/Make+Release/system/libGrappa.a`). To build and run an application or test, use the specific target. It will be built into the same directory hierarchy, but in this build directory. For example:

    # in `build/Make+Release`
    make graph_new.exe
    # generates <project_root>/build/Make+Release/applications/graph500/grappa/graph_new.exe
    # to run, use the 'srun' script which has been copied to build/Make+Release/bin:
    bin/grappa_srun.rb --nnode=4 --ppn=4 -- applications/graph500/grappa/graph_new.exe --scale=20 --bench=bfs

This is the simplest build configuration. You are likely to want to specify more things, such as a specific compiler, a directory for already-installed dependencies so you don't have to rebuild them for each new configuration, and more. So read on.

## Requirements
- CMake version >= 2.8.6
  - on the Sampa cluster: `/sampa/share/cmake/bin/cmake`
  - on Pal: `module load cmake`
- GCC version >= 4.7.
  - on the Sampa cluster: `/sampa/share/gcc-4.7.2/rtf/bin/{gcc,g++}`
  - on Pal: `module load gcc-4.7.2`
- MPI (tested with OpenMPI & Mvapich2)
  - on Sampa: should be autodetected
  - on Pal: `module load mvapich2/1.9b`

## Configure

The `configure` script creates a new "build/*" subdirectory and runs CMake to generate build files.

    --gen=[Make]|Ninja|Xcode[,*] Build tool to generate scripts for.
                                   Default: Make.
                                   Can specify multiple with commas.
    --mode=[Release]|Debug[,*]   Build mode. Default: Release (with debug symbols)
    --cc=path/to/c/compiler      Use alternative C compiler.
    --boost=path/to/boost/root   Specify location of compatible boost (>= 1.53)
                                   (otherwise, cmake will download and build it)
    --name=NAME                  Add an additional name to this configuration to distinguish it 
                                   (i.e. compiler version)
    --tracing                    Enable VampirTrace/gperftools-based sampled tracing. Looks for
                                   VampirTrace build in 'third-party' dir.
    --vampir=path/to/vampirtrace/root
                                 Specify path to VampirTrace build (enables tracing).
    --third-party=path/to/built/deps/root
                                 Can optionally pre-build third-party dependencies instead of 
                                   re-building for each configuration.

To build, after calling `configure`, cd into the generated directory, and use the build tool selected (e.g. `make` or `ninja`), specifying the desired target (e.g. `graph_new.exe` to build the new Graph500 implementation, or `check-New_delegate_tests` to run the delegate tests, or `demo-gups.exe` to build the GUPS demo).

### Generators
**Make:** uses generated Unix Makefiles to build. This is currently the best option, as it is the best-tested. Of note, the Make generator seems to be the only one that supports saving the "tools" builds when running "clean" (which can then be cleaned with the `clean-tools` target).'

**Ninja:** supposedly does faster dependencies, especially for incremental builds, but `clean` target cleans dependent projects, so not currently recommended.

**Xcode:** seems unable to use anything but Apple's Clang to compile, which is not supported for Grappa yet.

**Others:** untested

### Build Modes
**Release:** builds with `-O3 -g`, so still has debug symbols.

**Debug:** builds with `-DDEBUG -O1`

## Third-party dependencies
CMake will download and build `gflags`, `boost`, and `gperfools`. It will build and install `GASNet` and `google-glog` from the `tools/` directory.

The external dependencies can be shared between Grappa configurations. If you specify a directory to `--third-party`, CMake will build and install the dependencies there, and then any other configurations will reuse them. Sometimes this won't work; for instance, if using two different compilers, you may have difficulty sharing a third-party directory. If this happens, just make a new third-party directory and rebuild them using the new configuration, or don't specify it and have this configuration build them just for itself.

Because Boost takes the longest to compile and is often included in systems, Boost can be specified separately from the other third-party installs. Existing system installs of the other dependencies should typically *not* be relied on.

## CMake Notes
A couple notes about adding new targets for CMake to build. First: each directory where something is built should typically have a `CMakeLists.txt` file. Somewhere up the directory hierarchy, this directory must be 'added'. For instance, applications directories are added from `applications/CMakeLists.txt`:

    add_subdirectory(graph500)
    add_subdirectory(demos)
    ...

There are a couple custom macros defined for creating Grappa executables:

- `add_grappa_exe(target_name.exe [list of sources])`: creates an executable that links with `libGrappa`, depends on all the "tools" and has the correct properties set. Convention is that these use the '.exe' extension.
- `add_grappa_application(target_name [list of sources])`: same as `add_grappa_exe` but sets a property so it is tagged as an 'Application' in Xcode/VS.
- `add_grappa_test(target_name.test [list of sources])`: builds/links as a Boost Unit Test. Convention is to use '.test' for the extension. This will also create a second target: `check-#{target_name}` (without '.test'), which will build and run the test. This target also adds itself to the list of all test, which can be run with the `check-all` target.

**Note:** the generated build scripts (e.g. "make") will re-run `cmake` if any CMakeLists.txt files have changed. It can also be invoked directly to, for example, create a target to run, by calling:

    cmake ../..
    # or the `rebuild_cache` target, for example:
    make rebuild_cache

Note: the path must point to the directory where the root CMakeLists file is (in this case, from build/Make+Release, 2 directories up).

Another option sometimes useful is to use the "curses"-based UI, invoked by:

    ccmake ../..

### Starting fresh / changing compiler
If you want to re-configure some configuration from scratch, the best thing to do is delete the entire directory and re-run `./configure`. **You must do this if you want to change anything about the compiler.**

### Verbose
To get more output:
- When running CMake directly: `cmake --debug`
- When using `--gen=Make`: `make VERBOSE=1`
- When using `--gen=Ninja`: `ninja -v`

## Miscellaneous features
### Scratch directory
To make it easy to prototype ideas, there's a directory in root: `scratch`. Any `#{base_name}.cpp` files put here will automatically get their own target: `scratch-#{base_name}.exe`.

**Note:** in order to pick up the addition of a new file, `cmake` must be invoked, otherwise it will have no way to detect the new dependence. To do this from a build directory such as `build/Make+Release`:

    make rebuild_cache
    # then...
    make scratch-test.exe
    bin/grappa_srun.rb --nnode=2 --ppn=1 -- scratch/scratch-test.exe

### Demos
Similar to the scratch directory, all sub-directories in the `applications/demos` directory will be searched for `.cpp` files, and added as targets (`demo-#{base_name}.exe`). (note: search is not recursive, just one level of subdirectory).

### Distributed Build on Sampa
We're no longer using `srun` to distribute build jobs. Instead, it's possible to do a distributed build using `distcc`, it's just a bit more convoluted.

First, you must select the distcc proxy for gcc-4.7.2 that has been set up. If you've already configured, you have to blow the previous one away and start from scratch (see note about changing compiler).

    cd <grappa root directory>
    rm -rf build/Make+Release
    ./configure --gen=Make --mode=Release --cc=/sampa/share/distcc/gcc-4.7.2/bin/gcc

Before building, you must set up a Slurm allocation and launch distcc daemons. Best workflow is to launch 'make' with the slurm allocation, using our helper script:

    # in, for example, build/Make+Release:
    bin/distcc_make -j <target>
    # or for Ninja configurations:
    bin/distcc_ninja <target>

It is possible to control the number of nodes and the Slurm partition to be used by setting environment variables:

|------------------|------------------------------------|
| DISTCC_NNODE     | number of 'distccd' nodes to setup |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| SALLOC_PARTITION | Slurm partition to use             |
|------------------|------------------------------------|

Or just invoke salloc directly; e.g.:

    salloc -N8 bin/distcc.sh make -j <target>

Another alternative is to launch a shell to hold onto an allocation. This may be preferable if you are doing frequent builds or if distcc daemons are not loading correctly using the distcc_make option above.

    salloc -N8 <grappa-dir>/bin/distcc.sh bash --login
    cd build/Make+Release
    make -j
    ...
    # whenever finished with builds, relinquish allocation:
    exit


# Testing
We use Boost::Test to test 
The full list of unit tests is found in `system/CMakeLists.txt`. Here, a macro `add_check` is used to define a test and tell whether it is currently expected to pass or fail.

Each test defined in this way creates two targets: `*.test` which builds the test, and `check-*`, which runs the test. In addition, there are aggregate targets `check-all-{pass,fail}` which build and run all the passing or failing tests respectively, and `check-all-{pass,fail}-compile-only` which, as the name implies, only compiles them.

Non-exhaustive list of test targets:
- `New_loop_tests.test`: build loop tests
- `check-New_loop_tests`: build and run loop tests
- `check-all-pass`: build and run all passing tests
- `check-all-pass-compile-only`: just build all the tests expected to pass

Someday we'll get this up and running with some CI server, but until then, we'll just try and run it whenever we make significant changes.
