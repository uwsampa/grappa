To compile everything, type "make all"
To clean up everything, type "make clean"
To run everything using cpurun/mpirun, type "make run"

By default, "make run" only runs on 1 node.  To specify more than 1 node, 
use the NODES option to "make run".  For example, to run on 128 nodes,
you would type

make run NODES=128

To change the compiler or flags for a particular test, change the Makefile in
this directory.  You can now mix and match compilers on different tests
without any problems.  (It remakes the support files every time you compile 
a test.)

If you use something else than mpirun to submit a job, you will have to change
the appropriate line in the Makefile in order to run the benchmarks.
