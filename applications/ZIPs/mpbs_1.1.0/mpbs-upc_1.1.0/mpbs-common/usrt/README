To build usort, unpack the tarball and then just type make, assuming
this refers to GNU Make.

If make complains about an unknown platform, you'll have to hack the
makefile to define CC, CFLAGS, and CACHEMB for your new platform.
CACHEMB should be the size of the largest on-chip cache, in megabytes,
divided by the number of cores sharing that cache.  If unsure, it's
better to set it too low than too high.
