SUMMARY
-------

       This MPBS benchmark produces a large number of files,
       and then performs a two-stage sort on the contents of
       those files so that a single, large sorted file is
       produced.  The benchmark will be executed in two phases:
       1) file production, and 2) file content sort.  Each file
       is structured as a fixed, numbered sequence of buckets
       where each bucket consists of a fixed number of records. In
       Phase 1, each file is be produced by sequentially filling
       each bucket by with integer records.  The integer is set
       so that the most significant bits reflect the bucket
       number.  A file is complete when all buckets have been
       filled and written to disk.  In Phase 2, the records are
       sorted for a given bucket number across all of the generated
       files, and then written to a single file. This is done
       for each bucket.  This single file will contain all of
       the data from the Phase 1 files, completely sorted.

       NOTE: In cases where the number of PEs is not a power of 2 the
       benchmark will correctly sort the input files, but you will see a
       performance penalty from load imbalance due to how the buckets are
       distributed to the PEs.  This imbalance will be worse if using the
       -ss radix option for doing the data bucketing and final serial sort.

       We recommend setting the value of XT_SYMMETRIC_HEAP_SIZE to at
       least 1/2 of the value output by MPBS for "Memory usage per PE" plus an
       additional 10%.

       Use of OpenMP with SHMEM is supported when compiled with gcc.  Set the 
       value of OMP_NUM_THREADS as appropriate and launch with the flags 
       appropriate for your system (e.g. -d if using aprun on Cray). 



COMPILATION
-----------
       You may need to modify the Makefile to add the appropriate include and
       library paths.  Documentation for which variables to modify is located
       in the Makefile.  

       To compile, execute 'make'.

				       [-mmbs2 niter]

      PARAMETERS:

      -nf   Number of files to produce.
            Defaults to number of processes.

      -nb   Number of buckets per file.
            The number of buckets have to be one of the following values:
            1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048
            Default is 4.

      -rb   Number of records per bucket.
            Default is 64.

      -rm   Method by which the file data, by bucket, will
            be read into memory for parallel sorting.
            There are two methods:
            stripe - each process reads in a stripe of records
                     across all files.
            files (default)  - each process reads in data from a set of
                     files it has exclusive access to.

      -ss   Serial sort method:
            select - selection sort
            insert - insertion sort
            bubble - bubble sort
            radix  - high performance radix sort
            qsort  - quicksort(default)

      -id   Input  bucket  file  directory.   This is the location where the
            individual files of phase 1 will be written.
            Give relative or absolute path.  Default is cwd.

      -od   Output file directory.  This is the location  where  the  single
            sorted  output  file will be written.  Give relative or absolute
            path.  Default is cwd.

      -sfs  Sorted file size in integral GiB.  If this option is
	    specified, the default values for all parameters are used
	    and the number of records per bucket is set to create an
	    output file of the specified size.  Use of this flag
	    overrides the -rb flag and the -pm flag.

      -df   Delete the created intput files and sorted output file
	    on program completion.  Default is off.
 
      -dr   Dry run.  Display the header information only then exit.

      -pm   Use specified GiB of memory per PE.  May be a real number.  This 
      	    option will set the number of records per bucket required to fill
	    the specified size.  Do not use with the -sfs flag.  Use of
            this flag overrides the -rb flag.
 
      -tilt Execute niter iterations of the tilt kernel from CPU suite.

    -popcnt Execute niter iterations of a popcount kernel on random data.

      -bmm  Execute niter iterations of the BMM kernel from CPU suite.

      -gmp  Execute niter iterations of the GMP kernel from CPU suite.

      -k    Execute niter iterations of a collective communications kernel. 
            Specify the buffer size with -kbuf.  If a buffer size is specified
            but no number of iterations is specified, then the default is 1.
 
      -kbuf Use two buffers of size 2^n to do the collective communications
            kernel.  If -k is specified but -kbuf is not then the default size
            is 1 MiB per buffer.

     -mmbs2 Execute niter iterations of the mmbs2 kernel.  This kernel uses
            the SSE2 intrinsics and is not supported by the Cray compiler;
            an error will be displayed if this is attempted.

      -n    Name of sorted output file.  Default is "sorted".

      -i    Output system information.

      -v    Output version information.

      -h    Help menu.


READING OUTPUT
--------------

A convenient way to verify that the sorted output is correct for a very small
problem size is to use the od tool.  Assuming the sorted file is called 'sorted':

> od -v --format=u8 --width=8 sorted | more

This assumes the default standard record size of 64 bits.  

To do a verification of a large final sorted file you should use mpbs-verify.
Enter the mpbs-common/verify subdirectory and do:

mpicc -o mpbs-verify verify64.c

mpbs-verify takes two arguments:
$ mpirun -np N ./mpbs-verify <sorted_file> <input files>

It uses N PEs to calculate a parity checksum on the input files and sorted
file to make sure they match.  It also does a sort verification on the large
file.
