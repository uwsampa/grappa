mm_ops.h defines several operations on vector units. The macro VEC_WIDTH
must be defined to the vector width (in bits), and support operations
must be defined for the particular vector width / architecture / compiler
the mmbs2 and cksum benchmarks are being run on. Currently, mm_bs2.h
includes support for:

- 32-bit "vectors" (just normal uint32s)
- 64-bit vectors (including intrinsics/assembly for Itanium)
- 128-bit vectors (intrinsics for SSE2)

mmbs2 is a direct port of the bs2 benchmark to the vector case. It requires
VEC_WIDTH >= 64.

cksum is a checksum that operates on 32-bit words. See REAMDE.cksum for more
information.

Both benchmarks use the datatype typedefs and timing functions from bench.h.
