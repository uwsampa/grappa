   The routines in this directory are configured and compiled by the
bconfig script in the parent directory. This script will create a makefile
in this directory from the file makefile_template.mk . This makefile can
be used for the basic timing run. For the timed runs, copy the generated
makefile and make any appropriate changes.

   These routines are used by all of the benchmarks. They are compiled
once by bconfig and are linked into the benchmarks as required. Remaking
a benchmark does not recompile the routines in source.
