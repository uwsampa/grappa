   The makefile requires values for two macros FARM_ROOT and IO_DIR .

FARM_ROOT is the path to the farm_cpusuite directory
IO_DIR    is the path to the directory in which the IO test files will
          be read and/or written

The makefile contains two lines that can be added to set these macros

#FARM_ROOT	= ~/your path goes here or set FARM_ROOT in environment

and

#IO_DIR		= ~/your path goes here or set IO_DIR in environment

The macros can also be set in the environment

For esxample in the C shell

setenv FARM_ROOT /users/jadoe/benchmarks
setenv IO_DIR    /data/stageA/bmarks/iodir

  The Perl script `bconfig` (in the parent directory farm_cpusuite) reads file makefile_template.mk
and writes a configured makefile. The contents of Perl varables $cc, $cflags, $f90 and $fflags
are used to alter the makefile macros CC, CFLAGS, F90 and FFLAGS.

  Most of the makefiles have one or more `check` targets that can be invoked to run a benchmark
with specific parametes. The resulting output is compared to a known good output by `diff`ing.
If the run was valid, the diff files should just contain header and footer differences. Not
any difference in the data.
  In most cases `  egrep -v "END|INFO|INIT|---"  ` is then run on the diff output to further remove
more remaining extranious text. This output is found in the files prefixed with `tiny_`.

Remember that normally the `clean` target is preferred over `clobber` because the former does not
remove the constructed makefile.




The values in the output depend on both the seed argument and the iteration argument.

The seed is incorporated into the file names to help differentiate between runs

For example `tilt_101_correct_output`  for a the run of `tilt` using the seed 101
