The CPU suite is a set of benchmarks that measure various aspects of CPU
performance. It consists of the following benchmarks:

a_sort		: Does sorts on 64-bit integer data sets in two ranges. One 
		  range is around 2**16 and the other is around 2**25. The 
		  sort starts with an in-place bucket sort and finishes with 
		  a Shellsort. 
bmm		: Performs 64x64 bit-matrix multiplies with a fixed set of 
		  2**17 random input vectors and varying random matrices. 
		  Each result is reduced and accumulated into a 512-long table. 
bs2		: Computes the square of X MOD (2**16-1) for a series of random 
		  X values. The computation is performed using a 
		  bit-serial representation.  
cba		: Modifies a 2D bit matrix by accumlating mod-2 random rows 
		  into row 0. For each iteration the number of ones in the 
		  modified row is computed. 
tilt/ftilt	: Repeatedly tranposes a 64x64 bit matrix. tilt is a C 
		  implementation, ftilt is a F90 implementation. 
gmp		: Tests the speed of the mpz_powm() routine in the open source 
		  GNU multiprecision arithmetic library. This test primarily 
		  tests the speed of integer multiplies and adds for a processor. 
gt/sc		: Tests memory bandwidth for random loads(gathers) and stores 
		  (scatters). The data addresses have a flat random distribution 
		  in the ranges 0-2**8, 0-2**16, and 0-2**25. 
xba		: Tests the ability of the processor to conditionally add 
		  (mod-2) words based on flat random bits. Two equivalent 
		  constructs are used within the loop to check the ability of 
		  the compiler to recognize this idiom. 
xor		: Tests stride 1 memory accesses. The program reads two 32768 
		  long streams of 64-bit integers, exclusive ORs the values, 
		  and stores the results in a third stream. This is the public 
		  McCalpin's triad streams benchmark with integers replacing 
		  floating point numbers and and exclusive OR replacing the ADD. 

The benchmarks are run in the order and with the settings as follows:
