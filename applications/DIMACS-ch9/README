This code was written by Kamesh Madduri (Ga. Tech.) for the DIMACS challenge
and for our joint ALENEX07 paper.

make -f Makefile.mta

./shortest paths for a usage message.

example:

./shortest_paths -st -nSrcs 10 -trials 2 -graph cray -undirected -graph_args 3 3


This says "run st connectivity (bidirectional) with 10 different randomly-
chosen s-t pairs.  For each pair, do 2 trials.  Use the Cray "fancy graph"
generator.  There are 3 different classes of vertex degree, and we're to use
graph description "3".  I think that "3 10" would generate the 234M edge
instance.

Alteratively, you can select "-ds" to run the "delta-stepping" single-source
shortest paths (sssp) code that found sssp on a billion node RMAT graph in
roughly 10s using 40p on boomer.
