Note on the parallelization of transfer.f
-----------------------------------------

The file contains three major loops that update sparsely overlapped
mortar points.  Parallelization of these loops requires atomic update
of memory references by mortar points.  The first implementation
uses the ATOMIC directive to perform the job.  However, in some systems
where atomic update of memory references is not available, the ATOMIC
directive could be implemented as a critical section, which would be 
very expensive.  An alternative approach is to use locks to guard
atomic updates.  The second implementation scales reasonably well.
However, the overhead associated with calling lock routines deep 
inside loop nests could be large.

Two implementations:
   - transfer_au.f: use ATOMIC directive for atomic updates
   - transfer.f: use locks for atomic updates, as the default

To use the first approach, one can either rename 'transfer_au.f'
to 'transfer.f' before compilation or use the suboption "UPDATE"
in make:

   % make CLASS=<class> UPDATE=au

where <class> is one of [S,W,A,B,C,D].
