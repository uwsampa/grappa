This directory contains the MPI implementation of the NAS
Parallel Benchmarks, Version 3.3 (NPB3.3-MPI).  A brief
summary of the new features introduced in this version is
given below.

For changes from different versions, see the Changes.log file
included in the upper directory of this distribution.

For explanation of compilation and running of the benchmarks,
please refer to README.install.  For a special note on DT, please
see the README file in the DT subdirectory.
This version includes additional timers in several benchmarks.


New features in NPB3.3-MPI:
  * NPB3.3-MPI introduces a new problem size (class E) to seven of  
    the benchmarks (BT, SP, LU, CG, MG, FT, and EP).  The version 
    also includes a new problem size (class D) for the IS benchmark, 
    which was not present in the previous releases.

  * The release is merged with the vector codes for the BT and LU
    benchmarks, which can be selected with the VERSION=VEC option
    during compilation.  However, it should be noted that successful
    vectorization highly depends on the compiler used.  Some changes
    to compiler directives for vectorization in the current codes
    (see *_vec.f files) may be required.

  * New improvements to BTIO (BT with IO subtypes):
    - added I/O stats (I/O timing, data size written, I/O data rate)
    - added an option for interleaving reads between writes through
      the inputbt.data file.  Although the data file size would be
      smaller as a result, the total amount of data written is still
      the same.
