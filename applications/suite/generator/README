Graph500 Benchmark: Scalable Kronecker Graph Generator
Jeremiah Willcock and Andrew Lumsdaine

This directory contains a parallel Kronecker graph generator set up for the
requirements of the Graph 500 Search benchmark.  The generator is designed to
produce reproducible results for a given graph size and seed, regardless of the
level or type of parallelism in use.

Four Makefiles are provided: Makefile.seq (sequential), Makefile.xmt (Cray
XMT), Makefile.omp (OpenMP), and Makefile.mpi (MPI).  There are four
corresponding generator_test_* programs that demonstrate how to use the
generator.  The file make_graph.h declares a simplified interface suitable for
benchmark implementations; this interface hides many of the parameters that are
fixed in the benchmark specification.  Most compile-time settings for user
modification are in generator/user_settings.h and mpi/datatypes.h, with the
Kronecker parameters set at the top of generator/graph_generator.c.
