<h3 class="section">6.13 FFTW MPI Fortran Interface</h3>

<p><a name="index-Fortran-interface-494"></a>
<a name="index-iso_005fc_005fbinding-495"></a>The FFTW MPI interface is callable from modern Fortran compilers
supporting the Fortran 2003 <code>iso_c_binding</code> standard for calling
C functions.  As described in <a href="Calling-FFTW-from-Modern-Fortran.html#Calling-FFTW-from-Modern-Fortran">Calling FFTW from Modern Fortran</a>,
this means that you can directly call FFTW's C interface from Fortran
with only minor changes in syntax.  There are, however, a few things
specific to the MPI interface to keep in mind:

     <ul>
<li>Instead of including <code>fftw3.f03</code> as in <a href="Overview-of-Fortran-interface.html#Overview-of-Fortran-interface">Overview of Fortran interface</a>, you should <code>include 'fftw3-mpi.f03'</code> (after
<code>use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding</code> as before).  The
<code>fftw3-mpi.f03</code> file includes <code>fftw3.f03</code>, so you should
<em>not</em> <code>include</code> them both yourself.  (You will also want to
include the MPI header file, usually via <code>include 'mpif.h'</code> or
similar, although though this is not needed by <code>fftw3-mpi.f03</code>
<i>per se</i>.)  (To use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fftwl_</span></samp>&rsquo; <code>long double</code> extended-precision routines in supporting compilers, you should include <code>fftw3f-mpi.f03</code> in <em>addition</em> to <code>fftw3-mpi.f03</code>. See <a href="Extended-and-quadruple-precision-in-Fortran.html#Extended-and-quadruple-precision-in-Fortran">Extended and quadruple precision in Fortran</a>.)

     <li>Because of the different storage conventions between C and Fortran,
you reverse the order of your array dimensions when passing them to
FFTW (see <a href="Reversing-array-dimensions.html#Reversing-array-dimensions">Reversing array dimensions</a>).  This is merely a
difference in notation and incurs no performance overhead.  However,
it means that, whereas in C the <em>first</em> dimension is distributed,
in Fortran the <em>last</em> dimension of your array is distributed.

     <li><a name="index-MPI-communicator-496"></a>In Fortran, communicators are stored as <code>integer</code> types; there is
no <code>MPI_Comm</code> type, nor is there any way to access a C
<code>MPI_Comm</code>.  Fortunately, this is taken care of for you by the
FFTW Fortran interface: whenever the C interface expects an
<code>MPI_Comm</code> type, you should pass the Fortran communicator as an
<code>integer</code>.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

     <li>Because you need to call the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">local_size</span></samp>&rsquo; function to find out
how much space to allocate, and this may be <em>larger</em> than the
local portion of the array (see <a href="MPI-Data-Distribution.html#MPI-Data-Distribution">MPI Data Distribution</a>), you should
<em>always</em> allocate your arrays dynamically using FFTW's allocation
routines as described in <a href="Allocating-aligned-memory-in-Fortran.html#Allocating-aligned-memory-in-Fortran">Allocating aligned memory in Fortran</a>. 
(Coincidentally, this also provides the best performance by
guaranteeding proper data alignment.)

     <li>Because all sizes in the MPI FFTW interface are declared as
<code>ptrdiff_t</code> in C, you should use <code>integer(C_INTPTR_T)</code> in
Fortran (see <a href="FFTW-Fortran-type-reference.html#FFTW-Fortran-type-reference">FFTW Fortran type reference</a>).

     <li><a name="index-fftw_005fexecute_005fdft-497"></a><a name="index-fftw_005fmpi_005fexecute_005fdft-498"></a><a name="index-new_002darray-execution-499"></a>In Fortran, because of the language semantics, we generally recommend
using the new-array execute functions for all plans, even in the
common case where you are executing the plan on the same arrays for
which the plan was created (see <a href="Plan-execution-in-Fortran.html#Plan-execution-in-Fortran">Plan execution in Fortran</a>). 
However, note that in the MPI interface these functions are changed:
<code>fftw_execute_dft</code> becomes <code>fftw_mpi_execute_dft</code>,
etcetera. See <a href="Using-MPI-Plans.html#Using-MPI-Plans">Using MPI Plans</a>.

   </ul>

   <p>For example, here is a Fortran code snippet to perform a distributed
L&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;M complex DFT in-place.  (This assumes you have already
initialized MPI with <code>MPI_init</code> and have also performed
<code>call fftw_mpi_init</code>.)

<pre class="example">       use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding
       include 'fftw3-mpi.f03'
       integer(C_INTPTR_T), parameter :: L = ...
       integer(C_INTPTR_T), parameter :: M = ...
       type(C_PTR) :: plan, cdata
       complex(C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX), pointer :: data(:,:)
       integer(C_INTPTR_T) :: i, j, alloc_local, local_M, local_j_offset
     
     !   <span class="roman">get local data size and allocate (note dimension reversal)</span>
       alloc_local = fftw_mpi_local_size_2d(M, L, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;
                                            local_M, local_j_offset)
       cdata = fftw_alloc_complex(alloc_local)
       call c_f_pointer(cdata, data, [L,local_M])
     
     !   <span class="roman">create MPI plan for in-place forward DFT (note dimension reversal)</span>
       plan = fftw_mpi_plan_dft_2d(M, L, data, data, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;
                                   FFTW_FORWARD, FFTW_MEASURE)
     
     ! <span class="roman">initialize data to some function</span> my_function(i,j)
       do j = 1, local_M
         do i = 1, L
           data(i, j) = my_function(i, j + local_j_offset)
         end do
       end do
     
     ! <span class="roman">compute transform (as many times as desired)</span>
       call fftw_mpi_execute_dft(plan, data, data)
     
       call fftw_destroy_plan(plan)
       call fftw_free(cdata)
</pre>
   <p>Note that when we called <code>fftw_mpi_local_size_2d</code> and
<code>fftw_mpi_plan_dft_2d</code> with the dimensions in reversed order,
since a L&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;M Fortran array is viewed by FFTW in C as a
M&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;L array.  This means that the array was distributed over
the <code>M</code> dimension, the local portion of which is a
L&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;local_M array in Fortran.  (You must <em>not</em> use an
<code>allocate</code> statement to allocate an L&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;local_M array,
however; you must allocate <code>alloc_local</code> complex numbers, which
may be greater than <code>L * local_M</code>, in order to reserve space for
intermediate steps of the transform.)  Finally, we mention that
because C's array indices are zero-based, the <code>local_j_offset</code>
argument can conveniently be interpreted as an offset in the 1-based
<code>j</code> index (rather than as a starting index as in C).

   <p>If instead you had used the <code>ior(FFTW_MEASURE,
FFTW_MPI_TRANSPOSED_OUT)</code> flag, the output of the transform would be a
transposed M&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;local_L array, associated with the <em>same</em>
<code>cdata</code> allocation (since the transform is in-place), and which
you could declare with:

<pre class="example">       complex(C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX), pointer :: tdata(:,:)
       ...
       call c_f_pointer(cdata, tdata, [M,local_L])
</pre>
   <p>where <code>local_L</code> would have been obtained by changing the
<code>fftw_mpi_local_size_2d</code> call to:

<pre class="example">       alloc_local = fftw_mpi_local_size_2d_transposed(M, L, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;
                                local_M, local_j_offset, local_L, local_i_offset)
</pre>
   <div class="footnote">
<hr>
<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Technically, this is because you aren't
actually calling the C functions directly. You are calling wrapper
functions that translate the communicator with <code>MPI_Comm_f2c</code>
before calling the ordinary C interface.  This is all done
transparently, however, since the <code>fftw3-mpi.f03</code> interface file
renames the wrappers so that they are called in Fortran with the same
names as the C interface functions.</p>
