\section{Grappa} \label{sec:grappa}

In this section we describe the Grappa runtime system (Figure~\ref{fig:grappa}).  Grappa is a software runtime system that one adds to a commodity HPC cluster.  It provides the following software abstractions to applications: \textbf{memory}, a global distributed shared memory and \textbf{tasking}, co-operative multithreading with automatic load balancing.  Under the hood a third component, \textbf{communication}, a network packet scheduler/aggregator is key to achieving high performance, but largely invisible to applications.  We will now describe each of these components.
