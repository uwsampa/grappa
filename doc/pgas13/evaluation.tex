\section{Evaluation}
To evaluate the impact flat combining has on the global data structures, we ran a series of experiments to test the raw performance of the data structures themselves under different workloads, and further measured their impact on performance of two simple graph benchmarks.

\subsection{Data Structure Throughput}
First we measured the performance of the global data structures on extremely simple workloads to understand their raw performance.

\paragraph{Queue and Stack}
The GlobalQueue and GlobalStack have very similar implementations in terms of how they are synchronized. Both benefit greatly from flat combining. This is because only one round-trip message 

However, due to the nature of concurrent stacks, the stack is able to match up pushes and pops locally. This leads to performance on an even mix of pushes and pops far outstripping the case where all pushes are performed due to requiring vastly less communication.
