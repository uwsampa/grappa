%\TODO{paper.tex: I know we removed the programming model from the paper and
    % merged into the overview pieces, but I think we need at least a
    % brief summary of the machine model the programmer should be
    % thinking about. 1.large number of tasks, 2.PGAS model for thinking
    % of memory accesses where remote memory is expensive and
    % packets should be large when this is easily expressed, 3.
    % streaming writes are cheaper than writes that require consistency
    % in the task, 4.overlapping read/writes are better than
    % nonoverlapping. Thats a lot to think about but a compiler can at
    % least help with part of 2 and 4 and \Grappa lets you work less
    % hard on 2 by providing aggregation. -BM}
