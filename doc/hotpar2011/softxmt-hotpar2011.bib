author = {Lars Backstrom},
journal = {Presented at the SIAM Annual Meeting},
title = {People you may know},
abstract = {Facebook's friend recommendation system helps people
connect with their friends. Our system, called People You
May Know, uses a combination of results from sociology
and machine learning to make the best suggestions pos-
sible. We will look at some of the challenges involved in
building a system that can handle the scale of Facebook
and provide high quality recommendations. In this talk
I will discuss both the algorithmic and machine learning
challenges that we have faced and overcome in building
this system.},

title = {GraphStep: A System Architecture for Sparse-Graph Algorithms},
abstract = {Many important applications are organized around long-lived, irregular sparse graphs (e.g., data and knowledge bases, CAD optimization, numerical problems, simulations). The graph structures are large, and the applications need regular access to a large, data-dependent portion of the graph for each operation (e.g., the algorithm may need to walk the graph, visiting all nodes, or propagate changes through many nodes in the graph). On conventional microprocessors, the graph structures exceed on-chip cache capacities, making main-memory bandwidth and latency the key performance limiters. To avoid this "memory wall," we introduce a concurrent system architecture for sparse graph algorithms that places graph nodes in small distributed memories paired with specialized graph processing nodes interconnected by a lightweight network. This gives us a scalable way to map these applications so that they can exploit the high-bandwidth and low-latency capabilities of embedded memories (e.g., FPGA Block RAMs). On typical spreading-activation queries on the ConceptNet Knowledge Base, a sample application, this translates into an order of magnitude speedup per FPGA compared to a state-of-the-art Pentium processor},
