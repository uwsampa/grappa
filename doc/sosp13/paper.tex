\TODO{paper.tex: I know we removed the programming model from the paper and
    merged into the overview pieces, but I think we need at least a
    brief summary of the machine model the programmer should be
    thinking about. 1.large number of tasks, 2.PGAS model for thinking
    of memory accesses where remote memory is expensive and
    packets should be large when this is easily expressed, 3.
    streaming writes are cheaper than writes that require consistency
    in the task, 4.overlapping read/writes are better than
    nonoverlapping. Thats a lot to think about but a compiler can at
    least help with part of 2 and 4 and Grappa lets you work less
    hard on 2 by providing aggregation. -BM}
