Grappa is a latency tolerant runtime system for commodity clusters of
multicore computers. Grappa's goal is to provide scalable performance for
irregular parallel applications. These applications are of growing importance
as interactive analysis of large data sets emerges as a commercial and
government priority, typically in the form of graph processing. Grappa serves
both as a C++ user library and as a foundation upon which higher level
languages can be developed or adapted to support development of irregular
parallel applications. Grappa tolerates the delays to distant memory by
multiplexing thousands of lightweight tasks to each processor core; balances
load via fine-grained distributed work-stealing; takes full advantage of
network characteristics by aggregating smaller requests into large ones; and
provides efficient synchronization and remote operations across its single
shared address space. We present a detailed description of the Grappa system,
programming examples using the library interface, and compare performance for
several irregular benchmarks to the Cray XMT, a custom system used to target
the real time graph analytics market.
