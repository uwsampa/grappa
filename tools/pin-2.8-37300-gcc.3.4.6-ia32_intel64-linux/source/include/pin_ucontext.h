 * This file comes to solve a problem with including <sys/ucontext.h>.
 * Some Pin-tools/tests get register values from the ucontext structure
 * by using the REG_XXX enum value as the index to the gregset_t array.
 *
 * Changes in the header files in the new Linux versions (starting from
 * Fedora-13) cause the REG_XXX to get undeclared on the Pin-tools/tests
 * that include <sys/ucontext.h>.  To fix that, this file should be
 * included at the beginning of Pin-tools/tests (before any other system 
 * files are included) instead of the <sys/ucontext.h> file.

// DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
//
// In order to declare REG_XXX, we need to include sys/ucontext.h while
// having the __USE_GNU macro defined.  On systems older than Fedora-13
// we can achieve this by simply defining __USE_GNU before including
// ucontext.h.
// On Fedora-13 however, sys/ucontext.h is included from inside signal.h,
// and we cannot define __USE_GNU before including signal.h because doing
// that will affect other functions inside signal.h.
//
// Therefore, the solution to this problem is to include sys/ucontext.h
// as early as possible inside the application, define __USE_GNU
// beforehand and revert it to the state it was before we defined it
// (i.e. undefine it if it wasn't defined before).
//
// Since we use REG_XXX inside several Pin-tools/tests, this file is used
// to avoid code re-write - every Pin-tool/test that uses REG_XXX should
// include this file instead of sys/ucontext.h.
//


// features.h does not exist on FreeBSD
#ifndef TARGET_BSD
// features initializes the system's state, including the state of __USE_GNU 
#include <features.h>
#endif

// If __USE_GNU is defined, we don't need to do anything.
// If we defined it ourselves, we need to undefine it later.
#ifndef __USE_GNU
    #define __USE_GNU
    #define PINTOOL_UNDEF_USE_GNU
#endif

#include <ucontext.h>

// If we defined __USE_GNU ourselves, we need to undefine it here.
#ifdef PINTOOL_UNDEF_USE_GNU
    #undef __USE_GNU
    #undef PINTOOL_UNDEF_USE_GNU
#endif
