The Pintools in this directory make several assumptions:
  1. Your machine is booted into a kernel with the perfctr 
       patch.  Note that no standard Linux distribution has 
       a perfctr kernel, so you need to manually patch and 
       compile a new kernel.
  2. You have the PAPI installed, and libpapi.a is in your
       library path. 
  3. Your specific processor supports the PAPI counters that
       each Pintool accesses. The available counters vary
       by processor, so if you get a failure when adding a 
       counter, your processor probably doesn't support it.

These Pintools are provided for demonstrative purposes only.
They were tested on CentOS 4.5 machines (32-bit and 64-bit) 
with a 2.6.9-55.0.2.EL.perfctr26smp kernel and PAPI 3.5.0. 

Any questions regarding the installation of PAPI or a 
perfctr kernel should NOT go to the Pinheads mailing list,
but should be addressed to the PAPI mailing list hosted at
the University of Tennessee.
