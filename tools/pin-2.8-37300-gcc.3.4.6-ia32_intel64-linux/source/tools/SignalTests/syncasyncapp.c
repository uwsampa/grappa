/*
 * This test validates an edge case within Pin.  Pin checks for and delivers
 * any pending asynchronous signals at the end of each trace.  However, it
 * handles any synchronous signals (i.e. faults) immediately.  There is a weird
 * edge case if Pin has a pending asynchronous signal at the time a synchronous
 * signal is generated.
 *
 * In an old version of Pin, there was a bug that caused the application's
 * signal mask to be set incorrectly in the above case.  This test forces the
 * edge case to occur, and then validates that the signal mask is set correctly.
 *
 * Forcing the edge case is a little tricky.  The test expects to handle two
 * signals: a VTALRM (from an i-timer) and a SEGV (by executing an invalid store).
 * To force the edge case, we want the VTALRM to be delivered while Pin is
 * executing the basic block that contains the invalid (faulting) store.  Obviously,
 * this is a very small timing window.  We use a special Pin tool to open up this
 * timing window.  The Pin tool finds the basic block that contains the faulting
 * store and inserts a long-running analysis routine at the first instruction of
 * this basic block.  This essentially causes the basic block to run for a very
 * long time, which makes it much more likely that the VTALRM will be delivered
 * during that basic block.
