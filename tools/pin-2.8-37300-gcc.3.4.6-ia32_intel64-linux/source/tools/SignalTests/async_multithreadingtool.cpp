 * This tool is meant to be run on the application "async_multithreadingapp.c".  It attempts
 * to expose the following deadlock scenario.  Thread A enters an analysis
 * routine and acquires a tool lock.  Meanwhile thread B enters the VM
 * acquires the VM lock, and calls a call-back, which acquires the same tool
 * lock.  However, thread B blocks because thread A has the tool lock.  While
 * thread B is blocked, thread A recieves an asyncrhonous signal, and Pin's
 * handler attempts to acquire the VM lock causing deadlock.
