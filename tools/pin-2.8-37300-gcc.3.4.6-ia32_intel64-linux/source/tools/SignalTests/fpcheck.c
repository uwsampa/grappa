/*
 * This test verifies that Pin properly saves and restores the applicaton's
 * FP state when emulating a delivered signal.  The application's main thread
 * simply does some FP calculation in a loop while VTALRM signals are handled.
 * The signal handler also does some FP computation, which will change the
 * FP state.  If Pin doesn't properly save/restore the FP state, the handler
 * will mess up the main thread's calculations.
 *
 *********************************************************************************
 *
 * I have observed that this test occasionally fails on vs-lin64-4 (running SUSE10
 * on Intel64).  The cause of the problem is probably the same as the bug
 * described at the top of "xmmcheck.c".
