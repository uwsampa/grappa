// The tool callapp9.cpp and application inner.c showed a bug with the way REG_INST_G0 
// is handled.  That register should have the value "1" when executing code
// from PIN_CallApplicationFunction() and the value "0" when executing other
// code. However, after execution returns from the replaced function, REG_INST_G0
// continued to have the value "1". The correct behavior is is for REG_INST_G0
// to have the value "0" when it returns from the replacement function.
//
// The correct output is:
// At Inner G0=0
// Calling replaced Replaced()
// REPLACE_Replaced: REG_INST_G0=1
// At Inner G0=1
// REPLACE_Replaced: REG_INST_G0=1
// Returning from replaced Replaced()
// i=2
// At Inner G0=0
