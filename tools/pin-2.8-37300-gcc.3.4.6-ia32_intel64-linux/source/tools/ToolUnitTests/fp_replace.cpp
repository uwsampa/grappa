// Encapsulating all floating point operations within the Pintool
// replacement function inside "fxsave; emms" and "fxrstor" causes
// a seg fault.
//
// Robert reproduced this problem on vs-lin64-3. The problem is
// that the stack pointer is not properly aligned in the replacement
// routine and you get a segv trying to save an xmm to memory.
//
// (gdb) x/i$pc
// 0x2a96429676:	movaps XMMWORD PTR [rax-0x7f],xmm0
// (gdb) p/x $rax-0x7f
// $2 = 0x2a9816b8b8
//
// At the entry point, it should be 8 mod 16, but it is 0 mod 16.
