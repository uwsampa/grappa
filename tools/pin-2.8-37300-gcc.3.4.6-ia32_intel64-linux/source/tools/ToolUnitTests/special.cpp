/*
 * Demonstrate the multiversioning of traces to support specialization of instrumentation
 *
 * We instrument a procedure with 2 entry points: red and blue. See
 * redblue.s in the same directory. When we enter from red, we create the
 * red version of instrumentation. When we enter from blue, we create the
 * blue version of instrumenation. The procedure has common code that
 * should be instrumented differently depending on whether we are red or
 * blue.
 *
 * When we see the entry point for red, set the versioning so all targets
 * of this trace to red. When we see blue, we set the versioning of targets
 * to blue. When we see a ret, we clear the versioning.
 *
 * At the entry of a trace, we check the versioning and instrument it
 * appropriately.
