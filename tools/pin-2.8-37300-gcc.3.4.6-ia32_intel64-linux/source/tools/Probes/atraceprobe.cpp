  Demonstrates low cost instrumentation by selectively instrumenting the program.
  The uninstrumented parts of the program execution the original code and have no
  overhead. The application transitions to instrumented code by calling PIN_ExecuteInstrumented.
  This function must be passed a context, which is allocated by the application by calling
  PIN_NewThread().
  The application transitions back to original code by calling PIN_ExecuteUninstrumented. See an
  example application in mttraceapp.c.
