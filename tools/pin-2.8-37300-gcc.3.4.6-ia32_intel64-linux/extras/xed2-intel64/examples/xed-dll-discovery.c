/// @brief how to discover enum names for xed_iclass_enum_t

/*************************************************************************
   When using XED as a DLL or shared object, the enumerations can change
   from one version of XED to another if instructions (or features) are
   added. Each XED enumeration must be mapped to something your XED client
   can use for indepedent compilation.  This example shows how to discover
   the XED values for the xed_iclass_enum_t and construct a mapping from
   names that are constant to your tool to names that can vary.  You would
   need to this for each XED enumeration that your XED client uses.

   This builds a one map so that you can map things from your clients code
   to XED's names as would be required for an encoder. For a decoder you'd
   also need to invert the mapping so that you can mape from XED names to
   your client's names.
