 VampirTrace

VampirTrace consists of a tool set and a run-time library for instrumentation and tracing of software applications. In particular, it is tailored towards parallel and distributed High Performance Computing (HPC) applications. 

The instrumentation part modifies a given application in order to inject additional measurement calls during run-time. The tracing part provides the actual measurement functionality used by the instrumentation calls. By this means, a variety of detailed performance properties can be collected and recorded during run-time.

VampirTrace version is available as open source software under the BSD license, see 'COPYING'. The software comes as a source code package. It can be installed by using autoconf procedures, see 'INSTALL'.

For instructions on how use VampirTrace to instrument application programs so that they produce an OTF event trace when executed, see 'doc/UserManual.pdf'.
