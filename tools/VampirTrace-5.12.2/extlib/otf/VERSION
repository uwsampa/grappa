# This is the VERSION file for OTF, describing the precise version of OTF in
# this distribution. The various components of the version number below are
# combined to form a single version number string.

# major, minor, and sub are generally combined in the form
# <major>.<minor>.<sub>. If sub is zero, then it is omitted.

major=1
minor=10
sub=2

# string is used for alpha, beta, or release tags. If it is non-empty, it will
# be appended to the version number.

# history of release tags:

# library is used for the library versioning. These three numbers will be added
# to the name of the library (e.g. libotf.so.1.2.3).
# The meaning of these numbers is as follows (from left to right):
#
#   current            The number of the current API exported by the library.
#                      That must be incremented, if the API has changed.
#   revision           The implementation number of the most recent API
#                      exported by the library. A value of '0' means that this
#                      is the first implementation of the API.
#                      If any of the source for the library has changed,
#                      revision must be incremented.
#   age                The number of previous additional APIs supported by the
#                      library. If age is '2', the library can be linked into
#                      executables built with a release of the library that
#                      exported the current API number (current), or any of
#                      the preceding two APIs.
#                      If the new API is backward-compatible with the preceding
#                      release, age must be incremented. Otherwise, reset age
#                      to '0'.
