/** \defgroup writer Writer Interface
 *
 *  This interface should be used whenever a trace file is to be written as a
 *  whole.  Therefore, an initial call to the OTF_Writer_open() function
 *  allows to specify a number of streams which are going to be used to
 *  automatically partition the recorded event data. OTF than takes over the
 *  duty of distributing the data on multiple files.
 *
 *  \section writer_example A simple Example
 *
 *  \code
 *  #include <assert.h>
 *  #include "otf.h"
 *
 *  int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
 *  \endcode
 *
 *      Declare a file manager and a writer.
 *      \code
 * 	    OTF_FileManager* manager;
 * 	    OTF_Writer* writer;
 * 	    \endcode
 *
 *     	Initialize the file manager. Open at most 100 OS files.
 *     	\code
 *     	manager= OTF_FileManager_open( 100 );
 * 	    assert( manager );
 * 	    \endcode
 *
 * 	    Initialize the writer. Open file "test", writing one stream.
 * 	    \code
 * 	    writer = OTF_Writer_open( "test", 1, manager );
 *      assert( writer );
 *      \endcode
 *      
 *      Write some important Definition Records.
 *      Have a look at the specific functions to see what the parameters mean.
 *      \code
 *      OTF_Writer_writeDefTimerResolution( writer, 0, 1000 );
 *      OTF_Writer_writeDefProcess( writer, 0, 1, "proc one", 0 );
 *      OTF_Writer_writeDefFunctionGroup( writer, 0, 1000, "all functions" );
 *      OTF_Writer_writeDefFunction( writer, 0, 1, "main", 1000, 0 );
 *      \endcode
 *
 *
 *      Write an enter and a leave record.
 *      time = 10000, 20000
 *      process = 1
 *      function = 1
 *      Sourcecode location doesn't matter, so it's zero.
 *      \code
 *      OTF_Writer_writeEnter( writer, 10000, 1, 1, 0 );
 *      OTF_Writer_writeLeave( writer, 20000, 1, 1, 0 );
 *      \endcode
 *
 *      Clean up before exiting the program.
 *      \code
 *      OTF_Writer_close( writer );
 *      OTF_FileManager_close( manager );
 *
 *		return 0;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Compile this using $ gcc -o test test.c `otfconfig --libs`.

 *                      with monotonously increasing values e.g. a FLOP 
 *                      counter. OTF_COUNTER_TYPE_ABS on the other hand 
 *                      defines a counter with alternating absolute values e.g.
 *                      the memory usage of a process. The following counter
 *                      measurement scopes are supported:

 *                      to exactly this moment in time, OTF_COUNTER_SCOPE_LAST
 *                      relates to the previous measurement, and
 *                      OTF_COUNTER_SCOPE_NEXT to the next measurement.
 *                      Examples: OTF_COUNTER_TYPE_ACC + 
 *                      OTF_COUNTER_SCOPE_START should be used for most 
 *                      standard hardware (PAPI) counters. 
 *                      OTF_COUNTER_TYPE_ABS + OTF_COUNTER_SCOPE_POINT could
 *                      be used to record information 'spikes'.
 *                      OTF_COUNTER_TYPE_ABS + OTF_COUNTER_SCOPE_NEXT works
 *                      for memory allocation recording. 
 * @param counterGroup  A previously defined counter group identifier or 0 
 *                      for no group.
 * @param unit          Unit of the counter e.g. "#" for "number of..." or 0
