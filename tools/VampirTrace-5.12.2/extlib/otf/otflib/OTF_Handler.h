/** \defgroup handler Handler Interface
 *
 * In the following, the handler interfaces for all record types are
 * specified. The signature of callback handler functions is equal to the
 * signature of corresponding record write functions except for the first
 * argument. The first argument common to all callback handler functions is
 * \em userData -- a generic pointer to custom user data. The second common
 * argument to all callback hander functions is \em stream which identifies the
 * stream where the definition occurred. A stream parameter = 0 indicates a
 * global definition which is the default.
 */

/** 
 * \defgroup ha Handler Array Interface
 *
 * Using this interface you can setup a handler array for reading traces.

 * @param properties    A combination of a type, scope and vartype counter property.
 *                      OTF_COUNTER_TYPE_ACC (default) represents a counter
 *                      with monotonously increasing values e.g. a FLOP 
 *                      counter. OTF_COUNTER_TYPE_ABS on the other hand 
 *                      defines a counter with alternating absolute values e.g.
 *                      the memory usage of a process. The following counter
 *                      measurement scopes are supported: 
 *                      OTF_COUNTER_SCOPE_START (default) always refers to the 
 *                      start of the process, OTF_COUNTER_SCOPE_POINT refers
 *                      to exactly this moment in time, OTF_COUNTER_SCOPE_LAST
 *                      relates to the previous measurement, and
 *                      OTF_COUNTER_SCOPE_NEXT to the next measurement.
 *                      Examples: OTF_COUNTER_TYPE_ACC + 
 *                      OTF_COUNTER_SCOPE_START should be used for most 
 *                      standard hardware (PAPI) counters.

 *                      be used to record information 'spikes'.
 *                      OTF_COUNTER_TYPE_ABS + OTF_COUNTER_SCOPE_NEXT works
 *                      for memory allocation recording.
 *                      The data type can be one of the following:
 *                      COUNTER_VARTYPE_{UNSIGNED8,SIGNED8,UNSIGNED4,SIGNED4,
 *                      UNSIGNED2,SIGNED2,DOUBLE,FLOAT}
 *                      You may also use COUNTER_VARTYPE_IS{INTEGER,SIGNED,
 *                      UNSIGNED}(property) to a get a clue about the data type.
 * @param counterGroup  A previously defined counter group identifier or 0 for
 *                      no group.
 * @param unit          Unit of the counter e.g. "#" for "number of..." or 0 
 *                      for no unit.
 *
 * @param list          Pointer to an OTF_KeyValueList() that contains individual data.

 *                       - OTF_IOFLAG_ASYNC -- I/O is done asynchronously
 *                       - OTF_IOFLAG_COLL -- this is a collective I/O operation
 *                       - OTF_IOFLAG_DIRECT -- I/O is done bypassing the cache
 *                       - OTF_IOFLAG_SYNC -- I/O is done synchronously
