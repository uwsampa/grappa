/* NOTE
the OTF_RStream interface is not able to perform jumps to random timestamps,
and cannot quit at a certain maximum time stamp.
Maybe in future versions we add this. 
It is not in, because the OTF_Reader interface uses the buffer-methodes directly
to set the timestamps, so saving it in the stream too will be worthless in this

/** \defgroup rstream Stream Reader Interface
 *
 * rstream provides an interface for dealing with a single stream of a trace.
 * A stream consists of up to four different buffers (event buffer,
 * definition buffer, snapshots buffer, statistics buffer).
 *
 * rstream is structured similarly to the reader, but it is not
 * able to perform jumps to random timestamps, and cannot quit at a certain
 * maximum time stamp.
 *
 * \section rstream_example A simple Example
 *
 * Common includes
 * \code
 * #include <stdio.h>
 * #include <assert.h>
 * #include "otf.h"
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * Define the Handler(s).
 * We just want to process the def process event and print out all appearing processes.
 * \code
 * int handleDefProcess (void *userData, uint32_t stream, uint32_t process, const char *name, uint32_t parent) {
 *
 *     printf( "process %u is named \"%s\"\n", process, name );
 *
 *     return OTF_RETURN_OK;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \code
 * int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
 * \endcode
 *
 *     Declare a file manager, a reader, and a handler array
 *     \code
 *     OTF_RStream* rstream;
 *     OTF_FileManager* manager;
 *     OTF_HandlerArray* handlers;
 *     \endcode
 *
 *     Initialize the file manager. Do not open more than 100 files.
 *     \code
 *     manager= OTF_FileManager_open( 100 );
 *     assert( manager );
 *     \endcode
 *
 *     Initialize the handler array.
 *     \code
 *     handlers = OTF_HandlerArray_open();
 *     assert( handlers );
 *     \endcode
 * 
 *     Initialize the rstream object.
 *     \code
 
 *     rstream = OTF_RStream_open( "mytrace", 0, manager );
 *     assert( rstream );
 *     \endcode
 *
 *     Register your callback functions to the handler array.
 *     \code	
 *     OTF_HandlerArray_setHandler( handlers, (OTF_FunctionPointer*) handleDefProcess, OTF_DEFPROCESS_RECORD );
 *     \endcode
 *
 *
 *     Do the actual reading.
 *     \code
 *     OTF_RStream_readDefinitions( rstream, handlers );
 *     \endcode
 *
 *
 *     Clean everything up before exiting the program.
 *     \code
 *     OTF_RStream_close( rstream );
 *     OTF_HandlerArray_close( handlers );
 *     OTF_FileManager_close( manager );
 *
 *     return 0;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Compile and link this using $ gcc -o test test.c `otfconfig --libs`.
