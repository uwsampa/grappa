otf python bindings
--

The interface is exact the same as in C
except:
  - all 'OTF_*_*Progress' functions return a list of 4 values, namely
    [old-return-value, minimum, current, maximum] and take only one argument,
    which is a pointer to a OTF_{Reader,RStream} object

  - the function 'OTF_KeyValueList_getByteArray' returns a list of 3 objects,
    where the third object is a list, that contains the byte array. The first
    object is the return-value and the second holds the length of the array.
    This functions expects two arguments (OTF_KeyValueList*, uint32_t)

  - all other 'OTF_KeyValueList_get*' functions return a list of 2 values, namely
    [return-value, value] and take only 2 arguments (OTF_KeyValueList*, uint32_t)
