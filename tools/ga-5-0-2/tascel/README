FOR THE IMPATIENT
=================

The command::

    ./configure && make && make install

should compile the static tascel library (libtascel.a) and install
headers and libraries to /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib,
respectively.

Please refer to the INSTALL file for generic build instructions.  That is a
good place to start if you are new to using "configure; make; make install"
types of builds.  Detailed instructions are covered later in this file.

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?
===========================

The documentation, based on doxygen source code comments, is available
in doc/ sub-directory.


ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE
===================

Tascel is a task scheduling library, compatible with MPI and ARMCI,
that implements algorithms for dynamic load balancing. It builds
upon the algorithms developed in the implementation of the SCIOTO
library for dynamic load balancing.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE (ALPHABETICALLY)

- src               (implementation of tascel algorithms)
- examples          (example programs using tascel)
  + scf             (SCF algorithm implemented with tascel)
- test              (small test programs)
- doc               (documentation)
- m4                (autoconf macros)
- build-aux         (autotools support scripts)


HOW TO BUILD THE PACKAGE?
