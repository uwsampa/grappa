/** @file barrier.c
 *
 * This file implements the "barrier" synchronization construct.
 *
 * A barrier causes threads to wait until a set of threads has
 * all "reached" the barrier. The number of threads required is
 * set when the barrier is initialized, and cannot be changed
 * except by reinitializing.
 *
 * The barrier_init() and barrier_destroy() functions,
 * respectively, allow you to initialize and destroy the
 * barrier.
 *
 * The barrier_wait() function allows a thread to wait for a
 * barrier to be completed. One thread (the one that happens to
 * arrive last) will return from barrier_wait() with the status
 * -1 on success -- others will return with 0. The special
 * status makes it easy for the calling code to cause one thread
 * to do something in a serial region before entering another
 * parallel section of code.
