ARMCI EXAMPLES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
============

The benchmarks directory has many ARMCI benchmarks.

The features directory has examples and notes on each of the features
listed below:

1. aggregation
2. gpc
3. non-blocking
4. proc_affinity
5. concurrency
6. notification
7. symmetric_memory

Compiling
=========

The examples directory is built by the top-level Makefile after a successful
"configure" run.  You can run "make checkprogs" to build the test programs and
the example programs together, or "make examples" to build only the example
programs.  Remember, run "make" from the top level, not from the testing or
examples directories!

Execution
=========

Any example that expects an input also has a README in its directory
explaining how to use it.
