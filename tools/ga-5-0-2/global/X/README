xregion -- GA visualization tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

xregion displays transitional access patterns for a two-dimensional array.
Both sampling time for the animation and slowdown factor can be specified to
animate long- and short- lasting events. At the end of animation, a cumulative
time lost due to contention in access to individual array elements is
displayed. The color coding (from white to navy) reflect access contention
level for the animation, and the access contention integral for the final
display.

Usage
=====

The program was tested on the SUN and SGI platforms only !
It is a 16-bit display version. 

::

    xregion <filename> [Xtoolkit options]

    where:

    filename - name of the input file (data processed by 'adjust' program)

    The file must contain:

    <number of rows> <number of columns> <num_events>
    <N - number of row partitions> <M - number of column partitions> 
    <row_part_1>
    ....
    <row_part_N>
    <column_part_1>
    ....
    <column_part_M>
    <trace DATA generated by program adjust>

    num_events - the number of events to be read and processed from filename
                 (might be specified larger than teh actual number records)

Example
=======
xregion adjust.ed
