Molecular Dynamics of Lennard Jones System using Global Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 3 classes of parallelization: Atom, Force and Spatial Decomposition.
The current implementation is based on force decomposition and uses global
arrays (GA).

Algorithm
=========

The entire force matrix (N x N) is divided into multiple blocks (m x m) for
dynamic load balancing, where m is the block size and N is the total number of
atoms/particles. The force between two atoms/particles can be approximated by
Lennard Jones potential energy function.

Block Topology (of Force Matrix)
--------------------------------

Say for example if there are 4 block and 100 atoms, the size of the force
matrix is 100x100 and each block size is 50x50. (Dynamic Load Balancing) Each
process (say 2 process example) gets one block each, and once it is done with
a block, it gets the next block in the queue (atomic task array). 

Using Newton's laws of equation and Velocity-Verlet algorithm, the velocities
and coordinates are updated for the next time step.

An output file output.dat is created in Molden format, when the variable
WRITE_TO_FILE is set. For optimum performance, BLOCK SIZE should be set
appropriately depending upon the problem size (number of atoms/particles).
