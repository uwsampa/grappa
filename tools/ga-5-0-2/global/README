GLOBAL ARRAYS LIBRARY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DEPENDENCIES ON OTHER SOFTWARE
==============================

- ARMCI - one-sided communication library used by GA as its run-time system
  This s/w is new in release 3.0

- MPI or TCGMSG: more or less extensive run-time support is required. For
  example, a message-passing library is used on some platforms to
  fork processes, implement broadcast, ga_dgop;

- MA (memory allocator by Greg Thomas)

- GA eigensolver, ga_diag, is a wrapper for the eigensolver from
  PEIGS library; (Please contact George Fann <gi_fann@pnl.gov> about
  PEIGS)

- BLAS library is required for the eigensolver and ga_dgemm;

- LAPACK library is required for the eigensolver;

- MPI, SCALAPACK, PBBLAS, and BLACS libraries are required for
  ga_lu_solve, ga_cholesky, ga_llt_solve, ga_spd_invert, ga_solve. If
  you do not install these libs, the named operations will not be
  available.

BUILDING GA 
===========
Please refer to the README in the base distribution directory.

TEST PROGRAMS
=============
Please refer to the README in the base distribution directory for details on
running the GA test suite.

TEST PROGRAM NOTES
==================
- Program testspd.x should work only with the ScaLAPACK and MPI.

- Another example program that uses GA is called jacobi.x. The Jacobi
  iterative method is used to solve a system of linear equations
  generated in the solution process of a partial differential
  equation by the finite differences method.

- To run test programs with TCGMSG that creates the GA processes on
  the shared memory and (network of) workstations; execute them you
  should use 'parallel' program -- built in tcgmsg/ipcv4.0::

    parallel testing/test.x

  For a single processor execution 'parallel' is not required and the
  program can be run as::
            
    testing/test.x

  or under control of your favorite debugger. 

  On MPP like T3D, IBM SP, and Intel machines, use appropriate system
  command to specify the number of processors, load and run the
  programs. For example, to run on four processors of the Cray T3D
  use::

    mppexec testing/test.x -npes 4
