GA Trace Library 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The library contains tracing routines for GA operations. The GA library has to
be created with tracing enabled. There are two programs: 'adjust' that
processes and integrates the trace files into a single one, and 'collisions'
that analyses this file with respect to the overlapping access to sections of
GA arrays. The output from 'adjust' can be used as an input to the GA
visualization program 'xregion'.  The trace library depends on the MA memory
allocator.

Usage
===== 

The user's program first calls subroutine trace_init(n) to initialize tracing.
n specifies the maximum number of events to be traced. An event is defined as
a single access to a part of or entire array.  Tracing is disabled by calling
subroutine trace_end(proc), where proc is the current processor number. At
this point trace file for processor proc is written to the disk. The file name
is the corresponding processor number coded with three digits.
 
For each event the following data is recorded: 

- processor number
- array handle
- coordinates of the section of an array being accessed
- GA operation code
- time stamps
