                      Disk Resident Arrays Implementation Notes

Assumptions:
. ANSI C compiler is not required;
. interface to C programs is minimal (most users program in Fortran)  
. low level I/O operations defined in ELIO library
. upper layer knows if they are called collectively or not

C Interface:
. C programs must use Integer and DoublePrecision data types,
  defined in "global.h" (GA package) for both the GA and DRA, and include
  file "dra.h";
. all arguments passed by address;
. names of DRA operations have capitalized DRA prefix i.e., C version of 
  Fortran dra_init is DRA_init. Note that the names are converted by cpp as 
  specified in "dra.h" so that in most cases, C and Fortran programs call 
  the same function. Internal convention is that there is a separate   
  Fortran wrapper to a DRA operation iff it has a character string 
  argument(s).
  
Implementation Status:
. prototyping used for DRA functions if ANSI C compiler available
. indexing arguments are currently implemented as integers 
. reshaping and transposing in dra_[write,read]_section not implemented yet


Problems to Resolve:
. do we need explicit dra_flush or we should handle it implicitly after
  each write when file is create in 'read+write' in  mode ?
