Summary
-------

     TCGMSG is a toolkit for writing portable parallel programs using
a message passing model.  Supported are a variety of common UNIX
workstations, mini-super and super computers and hetrogenous networks
of the same, along with true parallel computers such as the Touchstone
Delta, the Intel iPSC, the Intel Paragon, the Kendall Square Research
KSR-1, and the Alliant FX/2800 MPP system.  Applications port between
all of these environments without modification to the parallel
constructs.  This toolkit is available without charge, along with a
set of example 'chemistry' applications.  We are using this toolkit in
our production codes, but cannot guarantee support or accept any
liability for its use.

Release Notes (4.04)
--------------------

  1)  Several bug fixes for SUN and Intel

  2)  Fixed, but slow, KSR port ... bug KSR to get their act together

  3)  Paragon port

  4)  DEC Alpha port (thanks to Nico Sanna, Rome)

  5)  Implemented bitwise OR operation for IGOP

  6)  Fixed UNIX version so that an executable invoked on its own (i.e.,
      without using the parallel command) functions correctly as a single
      process ... this is very useful for debugging (thanks to J. Nieplocha).

  7)  Probe now formally supported on all platforms
