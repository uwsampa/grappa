There are two FORTRAN compilers for the DecStation.  The default is to
compile to the newer one (from DEC).  If you have the MIPS compiler
(which would show up as missing externals f77argc and f77argv) then


       a) in the tcgmsg directory do

          make realclean
          make machdep MACHINE=ULTRIX

       b) edit the ipcv4.0/Makefile to remove the -DDECFORT
          flag from the defines

       c) in the tcgmsg level directory 

          make everything
