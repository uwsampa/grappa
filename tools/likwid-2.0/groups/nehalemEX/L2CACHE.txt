Formulas:
L2 request rate = L2_DATA_RQSTS_DEMAND_ANY / INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
L2 miss rate  = L2_RQSTS_MISS / INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
L2 miss ratio = L2_RQSTS_MISS / L2_DATA_RQSTS_DEMAND_ANY

This group measures the locality of your data accesses with regard to the
L2 Cache. L2 request rate tells you how data intensive your code is
or how many Data accesses you have in average per instruction.
The L2 miss rate gives a measure how often it was necessary to get
cachelines from memory. And finally L2 miss ratio tells you how many of your
memory references required a cacheline to be loaded from a higher level.
While the Data cache miss rate might be given by your algorithm you should
try to get Data cache miss ratio as low as possible by increasing your cache reuse.
Note: This group might need to be revised!
