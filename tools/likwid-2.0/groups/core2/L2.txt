Formulas:
L2 Load [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*L1D_REPL*64/time
L2 Evict [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*L1D_M_EVICT*64/time
L2 bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*(L1D_REPL+L1D_M_EVICT)*64/time
-
Profiling group to measure L2 cache bandwidth. The bandwidth is
computed by the number of cacheline allocated in the L1 and the 
number of modified cachelines evicted from the L1. 
Note that this bandwidth also includes data transfers due to a
write allocate load on a store miss in L1.
