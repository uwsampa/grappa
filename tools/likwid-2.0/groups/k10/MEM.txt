SHORT Main memory bandwidth in MBytes/s

EVENTSET
PMC0  NORTHBRIDGE_READ_RESPONSE_ALL
PMC1  OCTWORDS_WRITE_TRANSFERS
PMC2  DRAM_ACCESSES_DCTO_ALL
PMC3  DRAM_ACCESSES_DCT1_ALL

METRICS
Read data bandwidth (MBytes/s)  1.0E-06*PMC0*64.0/time
Write data bandwidth (MBytes/s)  1.0E-06*PMC1*8.0/time
DRAM bandwidth (MBytes/s)   1.0E-06*(PMC2+PMC3)*64.0/time

LONG
Formulas:
Read data bandwidth (MBytes/s)  1.0E-06*NORTHBRIDGE_READ_RESPONSE_ALL*64/time
Write data bandwidth (MBytes/s)  1.0E-06*OCTWORDS_WRITE_TRANSFERS*8/time
Memory bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*(DRAM_ACCESSES_DCTO_ALL+DRAM_ACCESSES_DCT1_ALL)*64/time
-
Profiling group to measure memory bandwidth drawn by all cores of a socket.
Note: As this group measures the accesses from all cores it only makes sense
to measure with one core per socket, similiar as with the Intel Nehalem Uncore events.
