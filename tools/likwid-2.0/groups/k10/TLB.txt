L1 DTLB request  rate tells you how data intensive your code is
or how many Data accesses you have in average per instruction.
The DTLB miss  rate gives a measure how often a TLB miss occured
per instruction. And finally L1 DTLB  miss ratio tells you how many
of your memory references required caused a TLB miss in average.
NOTE: The L2 metrics are only relevant if L2 DTLB request rate is equal to the L1 DTLB miss rate!
