METRICS
Branch rate   PMC1/PMC0

Instructions per branch  PMC0/PMC1

LONG
Formulas:
Branch rate = BRANCH_RETIRED / INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED
Branch misprediction rate = BRANCH_MISPREDICT_RETIRED / INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED
Branch misprediction ratio = BRANCH_MISPREDICT_RETIRED / BRANCH_RETIRED
Branch taken rate = BRANCH_TAKEN_RETIRED / INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED
Branch taken ratio = BRANCH_TAKEN_RETIRED / BRANCH_RETIRED
Instructions per branch = INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED / BRANCH_RETIRED
-
The rates state how often in average a branch or a mispredicted branch occured
per instruction retired in total. The Branch misprediction ratio sets directly
into relation what ration of all branch instruction where mispredicted.
Instructions per branch is 1/Branch rate. The same applies for the branches
taken metrics.
