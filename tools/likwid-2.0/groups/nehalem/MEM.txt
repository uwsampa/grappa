Formulas:
Memory bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*(UNC_QMC_NORMAL_READS_ANY+UNC_QMC_WRITES_FULL_ANY)*64/time
Remote Read BW [MBytes/s] =  1.0E-06*(UNC_QHL_REQUESTS_REMOTE_READS)*64/time;
-
Profiling group to measure memory bandwidth drawn by all cores of a socket.
This group will be measured by one core per socket. The Remote  Read BW  tells you if
cachelines are transfered between sockets, meaning that cores access data owned by a remote
NUMA domain.
