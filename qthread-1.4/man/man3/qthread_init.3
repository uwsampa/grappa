.SH NAME
.BR qthread_init ,
.B qthread_initialize
\- initialize the qthread library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <qthread/qthread.h>

.I int
.br
.B qthread_init
.RI "(const int " nshepherds );
.PP
.I int
.br
.B qthread_initialize
();
.SH DESCRIPTION
Use these functions to initialize the qthreads environment before using any
other qthread functions. The
.BR qthread_init ()
function is deprecated in favor of
.BR qthread_initialize ()
which will attempt to auto-detect the correct number of shepherds for the system. The number of shepherds can be forcibly specified with the
environment variable
.BR QTHREAD_NUM_SHEPHERDS .
The
.BR qthread_init ()
function is a wrapper around
.BR qthread_initialize ()
that simply exports the
.B QTHREAD_NUM_SHEPHERDS
environment variable.
If 
.B QTHREAD_NUM_SHEPHERDS
is 0 or unset, the library will attempt to guess the correct number of
shepherds, defaulting to a single shepherd if no information about the system
could be found. Shepherds will attempt to pin themselves to processors using
whatever CPU affinity libraries are available.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The operation of
.BR qthread_init ()
is modified by the following environment variables:
.TP 4
.B QTHREAD_AFFINITY
If this variable is set to "no", then the shepherds will not pin themselves to
specific locations.
.TP
.B QTHREAD_DEBUG_LEVEL
This variable is used to control the verbosity of debug messages that get
printed at runtime. Higher numbers increase the verbosity; a value of 0 is the
same as being unset, which prevents debug messages from being printed. This is
only applicable if debugging has been enabled when the library was built.
.TP
.B QTHREAD_STACK_SIZE
This variable adjusts the size of the stacks that will be created for each
thread. Changes to this value during the course of the program run are ignored;
the value is only considered when
.BR qthread_init ()
is run.
.TP
.B QTHREAD_NUM_SHEPHERDS
This variable specifies how many shepherds to create.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the system is ready to fork threads and 0 is returned. On error, an
non-zero error code is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 12
.B ENOMEM
Not enough memory could be allocated.
