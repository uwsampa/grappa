Most experiments require libgreenery.a, the library for green threads.  Before building experiments in this directory, go to greenery/ and run:
% make libgreenery.a

listwalk/ 
    linked list walking experiment

carlson/ 
    make measurements of prefetch_and_switch

matmult.c
    Sparse matrix multiply. Gives timing for run with pthreads and green threads.

    Build:
	1) make sure greenery is built
        2) % make matmult
    Usage:
	% ./matmult N [NZ] [cores] [iters] [thread/core]

	N 	- width/height of matrix
	NZ	- number of non-zero elements per row
	cores	- number of cores to use
	iters	- number of iterations of experiment
	thread/core - threads per core

treedepth.c
    Breadth-first search on binary tree, comparing single-thread with green threads.

    Build:
	1) make sure greenery is built
	2) % make treegen treedepth
    Usage:
	1) generate a tree.  Run "./treegen -h" for usage info.
	  ex:  % ./treegen 0.1 10000 "mytreefile"
	2) run experiment on the tree.  Run "./treedepth -h" for usage info.
	  ex:  % ./treedepth "mytreefile" 6
